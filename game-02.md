The first version of this simple script was done with GPT-4-turbo. It had from the beginning the bugs that I had to fix myself (see below).
I.e. neither GPT-4-turbo nor Copilot with GPT-4o based chat could understand the problems nor fix the specific issues.

Me: the character does not jump, can you fix it?
Copilot: Fix the character jump by ensuring the jump only occurs when the player is on the ground.
Note: Copilot did not really get the original issue, but fixed something else.
Copilot commit https://github.com/vreyespue/gen-browser-games/commit/87687b466a6c0976297de8137a03e3250ed7820b

Me: there is still a problem, i.e. the character does not jump at all
Copilot: Fix the character jump by ensuring the jump only occurs when the player is on the ground and the ArrowUp key is pressed.
Note: it does not understand that the jumping should be applied after avoiding the falling. At least not on its own.
Me commit https://github.com/vreyespue/gen-browser-games/commit/9d64da7161761ebe686f1ae325e945295208b94b

Me: ok now the problem is that the character does not stay in the platform, i.e. it falls again through the platform. Can you fix it?
Copilot: Fix the issue where the character falls through the platform by ensuring the player stays on the platform after landing.
Note: copilot did not change anything. It does not understand that only a little fix in one comparison (from < to <=) would suffice.
Me commit https://github.com/vreyespue/gen-browser-games/commit/2e54eef089d9a31c362d81ec2005c48d3553d03a

Me: can you add borders left and right?
Copilot: Add borders to the left and right of the canvas to prevent the player from moving off-screen.
Note: copilot did a good job, and injected the relevant code.

Afterwards I decided to reorder the steps withing the update() loop, by applying first the horizontal changes and afterwards the vertical.
