Me: the character does not jump, can you fix it?
Copilot: Fix the character jump by ensuring the jump only occurs when the player is on the ground.

Me: there is still a problem, i.e. the character does not jump at all
Copilot: Fix the character jump by ensuring the jump only occurs when the player is on the ground and the ArrowUp key is pressed.
Note: it does not understand that the jumping should be applied after avoiding the falling. At least not on its own.

Me: ok now the problem is that the character does not stay in the platform, i.e. it falls again through the platform. Can you fix it?
Copilot: Fix the issue where the character falls through the platform by ensuring the player stays on the platform after landing.
Note: copilot did not change anything. It does not understand that only a little fix in one comparison (from < to <=) would suffice.
